### <center>NLP HOMEWORK</center>
- project structure:
    - I divide this project into 3 parts:**CW** for cut words, **POS** for Part-of-Speech tagging and **NER** for  Named Entity Recognition . Every part is combined by the following four files:
        - dataset:preprocess the dataset
        - model:build a model
    - evaluate: evaluate a model, calculate the accuracy,recall and F1_score
        - run: run the part
- CW
    - model:HMM
      - Parameter estimate:MLE
      - Decode:viterbi algorithm
    - Evaluate:
      - Accuracy: 0.7784937575513492
      - Recall: 0.7972449063763095
      - F1_score: 0.7877577634689054
- POS
- NER
